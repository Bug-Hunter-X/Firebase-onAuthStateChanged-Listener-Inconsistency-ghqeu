The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger if the user's session is invalidated due to a server-side change (e.g., account deletion, or a change in the authentication provider).  This can lead to the app remaining in an inconsistent state where the user is logged in according to the client SDK, but not on the Firebase server.  This is especially difficult to debug because there isn't an obvious error message.
